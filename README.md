# ShoppingList2.0
This application is about organize your shoppings. 
With it you can create a list of places where you are going to buy something and within you put the items that you have to buy, how much costs and quantities.
You can see the items by clicking on the item on the list of places where will show you just the items that you will by at that place or 
by the button on navigation drawer (side screen) that will bring you all the items that you add on the app.


To do this app I used:
Data base: SQLite
ROOM
MVVM
OOP
Fragment structure 
Listener
Adapter
and others
Navigation Drawer
